function nextX = AHUpdate(system, X, u, y, noise)
% AHUpdate - Function encapsulating the update phase of a
% set-valued state estimation for a linear system with no uncertainties.
% 
% The function returns the set X(k) that satisfies the measurement set Y(k):
% X(k) = Xp(k) intersect_C Y(k) 
% 
% Syntax:  
%    nextX = AHUpdate(system, X, u, y, noise)
%
% Inputs:
%    system - structure with all the matrices from the dynamical model
%    X - propagated set-valued estimate X(k)
%    u - value of the actuation
%    y - measurement
%    noise - set for the noise
%
% Outputs:
%    nextX - A-H polytope with all values that can result in the
%    measurement y given the noise set.
%
% Example: 
%    m = 10;
%    X.G = rand(2,m);
%    X.c = zeros(2,1);
%    X.H = [eye(m);-eye(m)];
%    X.h = ones(2*m,1);
%    noise = X; % assume noise is equal to the state for illustration
%    system = struct('C',eye(2),'N',eye(2),'D',zeros(2));
%    X = AHUpdate(system, X, ones(2,1), 2*ones(2,1), noise)
